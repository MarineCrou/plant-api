Welcome to Plants !

## Introduction

This project was to enable is to better understand the use of React, APIs and Routers, to be able to create an interactive multi-page website.
I chose to go with a public plant api, as I love plants, and could create a somewhat useful website, to get to better learn about our dear living friends.
Unfortunately, this normally 2 days project, done in teams of 2 (pairing) was compromised for me, as I was under the weather.
Therefore, please bare in mind that all features were not added as hoped for, as I had overall a day to do this, solo. I still managed to meet the requirements, which were displaying a multi-page site, while pulling data from a public API and using bUlma (a css framework, introduced a day before the project) to design the website.
